 A software engineer who loves to code. and explore how computers work. I’m learning about security, programming in C and Assembly, and using Linux.
- 🔐 **Security Learner**: Exploring how to keep systems safe and understand security basics.
- 💻 **Low-Level Programming**: Studying C and Assembly to see how software talks to hardware.
- 🐧 **Linux User**: Enjoying the power and flexibility of Linux and learning how it works.
- 🛠️ **Compiler Builder**: Diving deep into how programming languages work by building a compiler from scratch.

I’m always learning new things and excited to connect with others who love tech too!
